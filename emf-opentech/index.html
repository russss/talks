          Hi, I'm Russ. Today I'm going to show you some of my holiday snaps from last summer.

          <aside class="notes">
          <p>Well, OK, it's a little more complex than that. My holidays don't tend to be very relaxing.
              And some of my slides are graphs because I love graphs.</p>

           <p>Back in 2010 my friend Jonty and I decided that running
           London Hackspace wasn't really taking up enough of our spare time.</p>

           <p>On the continent they have a tradition of running these hacker camps -
           in Germany they have the Chaos Communication Camp, and the Dutch run a
           similar event which they enjoy changing the name of to confuse you.
           The next Dutch event is in July and they're putting 3,500 people in a field for a
           week.</p>

        <section data-image="images/campsite.jpg">
        <aside class="notes">
           <p>Anyway, we decided that we didn't want to let the Europeans have
           all the fun. So, having never been to any of these things, we decided
           to give it a go in the UK.</p>

           <p>So, after a couple of pints in the pub, we decided on an appropriately pun-laden
                name and Electromagnetic Field was born.</p>

            <p>So, what's the point of a hacker camp?
            It's a cross between a music festival and a tech conference.

            <p>
            A load of geeks in a field for a weekend with talks, a ridiculously fast
            internet connection, power to the tent, and most importantly booze.</p>

           <p>And above everything else this is an entirely non-profit thing.</p>

            <p>Of course, we didn't have much experience running festivals,
                but how hard could it be?</p>
           </aside>
        </section>
        <section data-image="images/site.jpg">
          <h1>The Site</h1>
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>Well, it seems that the things you think are going to
            be easy end up being the hardest bits.</p>

            <p>In about March of last year we finally decided on a site - a park just
            outside Milton Keynes. It was pretty well-priced, and the people who
            own the parks seemed pretty cool.</p>

            <p>And in this picture it looks pretty idyllic, doesn't it?</p>
          </aside>
        </section>
        <section data-image="images/map.png">
           <aside class="notes">
           <p>Well, here's the aerial photo and 
                the first thing to note is the excellent transport links...namely the M1 there.
                Going right through the site. So it was a little bit noisy.</p>

               <p>The next thing to note is the sewage works just to the south.
               Thankfully the wind was blowing from the north for the whole event,
               because 
               </p>

              <p>And lastly, that little stream running through
              the middle. That's actually the output of the largest system
              of artificial flood-control lakes in Europe, and I hear they're
              not afraid to use it. The park floods for 15 days a year.</p>

              <p>As you may remember, last summer wasn't the driest on record.
              I got a bit worried so I wrote a scraper for the river level data
              on the Environment Agency website...</p>

        <section data-image="images/river-level.png">
        <aside class="notes">
            <p>I told you there'd be graphs.</p>
            <p>The red area there is the flooding level, and the line is when we ran EMF.</p>
            <p>Anyway...</p>

        <section data-image="images/mast.jpg">
        <h1>Networking</h1>
           <aside class="notes">
           <p>One of the main things that people noticed at EMF was that we had
           rock solid, immensely fast wifi, which is something a lot of conferences
           seem to have trouble with.</p>

           <p>Much of this can be attributed to having a significant proportion of
           the UK internet industry on our team. If you want an amazing internet
           connection, you really want the EMF network team on your side...</p>

        <section data-image="images/mast-up.jpg">
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>This is one of the masts we used - it goes up to 30m high and the
            other one sat in the car park of a datacenter a few miles away.</p>

            <p>Once this was finally set up, we were seeing about 380 megabits
                symmetrical bandwidth on the wireless link, which wasn't bad.</p>
            <p>Anyway, once everything was up and running it looked a bit like this:</p>
          </aside>
        </section>
        <section data-image="images/network-1.png">
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>I'm not sure how much of that you can read...</p>
            <p>This setup still astounds me, really. There are datacenters which have
            a worse connectivity than this field did.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>And that's just the connectvity.</p>
